# Changelog

## 1.28.0 (2026-11-08)

The services of a WSL distribution (the user: "lets have, in the WSL plugins, a breakdown of the major services running, the 'scanning function' should be capable of using openrc or systemd to look for init type and differentiate between somewhat trivial processes and major services that are online"): `machines/services.py`, one script run as root (the init
system found and PID 1; systemd's units with the memory of those running, OpenRC's `rc-status --all`, SysV's
`service --status-all`; the processes), `parse`, `classify` (major: Docker, databases, web, mail and DNS servers, SSH,
VPNs, the firewall, Liminal's apps; other: shown with its own description; the system's own: counted and named in a
note) and `Scan.table` for the platform's page; `WslDistribution.services` (a hook; the status carries the breakdown
and its table). Scanned only while the distribution runs, kept 30 s. A status, the Docker check or the instance list
no longer starts a stopped distribution (the plugin lifecycle: nothing runs that nobody uses); Docker inside is said
as last seen.

## 1.27.0 (2026-11-08)

The Linux plugins are for a native Linux machine only (the user: "the scope of linux administration is only on
native linux O/S"; "it's not for administrating WSL instances"; "Yes, firewall too"): `machines.linux.why_not_native(what)`
says why the machine the platform runs on is not one (Windows, macOS, a WSL distribution by its kernel's release or
WSL's variables), "" on a native Linux machine. `MachinePlugin.not_for_here()` ("" by default) is honored first by
the base status and by the Admin and Firewall bases' status and setup: the status says `applies` False with the
reason (`not_here_status`; the key documented since 24a07f6), the setup changes nothing, the platform offers no setup.
plugin-platform-admin-linux 0.4.0 and plugin-platform-firewall-linux 0.3.0 use them.

## 1.26.1 (2026-11-08)

A WSL plugin's setup says each step before it runs (the user: "Yes, do it" to a line when each step starts, so quiet
steps do not look stuck): `wsl --update` streams what it prints, a root file system's download shows how far it has got
on one line rewritten (saved as a part file, renamed once whole), the packages' update says it is starting. The
platform's terminal: a read held until there is output (`Output.wait`, `finish`; `Terminal.read(since, wait)`), so a
page keeps one read open and shows its echo at once (the user: "in the terminal, characters repeat": two reads at once
drew the same output twice).

## 1.26.0 (2026-11-07)

The WSL distribution plugins check this PC before installing their system (the user: "each plugin should have a scheme
for checking the environment to see if it supports installing the operating system it has in its name, if the criteria
are met according to the O/S, then the install method should be not locked out"): `WslDistribution.check()` (Windows
that runs WSL 2, WSL installed, its kernel, WSL 2.4.4 or later for a named install, the system on offer, the processor,
the free space; `ready` and `installed`, why not). Their long commands stream what they print to a setup's log that
has a `write` ("after the install is run a terminal pops up in the plugin and shows the install progress": `Wsl` runs
with `out`, wsl's words in UTF-8 through WSL_UTF8). `update_packages` brings the system's packages up to date by
apt, dnf or emerge ("after the install is complete, the user can use the plugin to update the environment's packages");
`terminal()` gives the command of a login shell into it, with a terminal of its own inside Linux ("the plugin also
allows for a user to login through a terminal in to the environment"); `machines.terminal`: `Terminal` (a process's
output read from an offset, the keys written to it) and `Output`. The resources monitor reads the disks' I/O, hardware
only ("lets get disk io ... in hwstats"; "the platform only cares about hardware"): `Disk`, `WindowsProbe.disks()`
(each fixed drive's counters, no rights needed), `LinuxProbe.disks()` (/proc/diskstats, whole disks), each disk's and
all disks' bytes read and written a second in the view (`disk`) and over time (`diskRead`, `diskWrite`).

## 1.25.0 (2026-11-07)

A Linux target defaults to Liminal's own WSL distribution on Windows (the user: "Yes, do it" to the Linux admin and
firewall plugins targeting Liminal's WSL distribution by default): `linux.Shell` without a target takes the installed
Liminal-Ubuntu, then Liminal-Fedora, Liminal-Gentoo (`wsl_distributions`, `liminal_distribution`), and says when there
is none (`liminal_missing`, `scope_note`). A firewall or admin plugin on a target that is not Liminal's runs no command
there: its status says why (`MachinePlugin.scope_note`) and its setup changes nothing. The user's own distribution is
never taken.

## 1.24.0 (2026-11-07)

A machine plugin says whether it is valid: set up for Liminal, on something of Liminal's own (the user: "if a plugin
is not in a valid state it has to be disabled"; "there are no WSL-liminally scoped installs, so all three WSL
plugins are invalid"; "only hardware stats and preferences seem valid atm"): `valid` and `why` in its status. A WSL
distribution plugin is valid with its own distribution installed, named `LIMINAL_PREFIX` + the distribution
(Liminal-Ubuntu): the user's own is never taken, and the setup installs Liminal's beside it (`wsl --install <source>
--name <name> --location <folder>`, WSL 2.4.4 or later). A firewall is valid on, guarding Liminal's, with Liminal's rules
and none of the framework's missing; an admin with the rights on Liminal's. `MachinePlugin.scope()`, `linux.Shell.scoped`
(this Linux machine, or a WSL distribution of Liminal's own: WSL's default distribution is the user's), `liminal_scoped`.

## 1.23.0 (2026-11-07)

The apps' charts and two controls in `ui/static`, for every app's page (the user: "allow me to right click on
the icons to disable them on the right icon menu, also allow for enable disable switch (left to right) on the
plugin description"): `charts.js` (`LiminalCharts.cards/draw/update`: line charts of series over time by the
data-viz rules, a crosshair and one tooltip for every line, the keyboard's arrows, the samples as a table,
redrawn in place on new samples), `menu.js` (`LiminalMenu.open`: a context menu at the pointer), and in
`liminal.css` the switch, the menu, the charts and the categorical slots `--series-1..7` for the dark and
light themes, validated against the page. The UI's preferences (the user: "add a preferences plugin for the
'UI' and add the different themes"): `ui.THEMES` (Dark, Midnight, Graphite, Light, Paper: liminal.css's),
`ui.preferences()`/`save_preferences()` over one file for every app on the machine (the data folder's
`ui.json`, LIMINAL_UI_FILE), `GET /api/ui` on every app's frame, and `theme.js`, which paints a page in it.
`resources.role_of`: the charts app's host processes are named by what they host ("Host: fetcher", "Host:
feed-massive") rather than "host command".

## 1.22.1 (2026-11-07)

Docker's repository is the distribution plugin's (`WslDistribution.docker_repository`), filled into the
family's recipe by `install_script()`: the library's code names no outside host (the charts app's boundary
rule), as the Gentoo plugin already names its own. A recipe needing a repository the plugin does not name
fails the docker step in those words.

## 1.22.0 (2026-11-07)

The resources monitor on Linux as on Windows (the user: "i need the hardware monitoring that was in charts,
it needs to be windows and linux agnostic, ie it runs on both ... hw-stats platform plugin"): `resources.
LinuxProbe` reads /proc and /sys (the processes' CPU time, memory, I/O, threads and open files; the machine's
CPU and memory; the adapters' bytes and link speed; every TCP connection, each with its process when it is
one reported), the figures `WindowsProbe` gives, so the `Monitor` reads both alike; `default_probe(match)` picks
it on Linux. The processes reported and their roles are parameters: `WindowsProbe(match)`, `LinuxProbe(match)`,
`Monitor(roles=, own=)` (the charts app's by default: `is_app`, `role_of`); `is_framework` and `framework_role`
take every Liminal app (the integrator, the login, the platform with their ports). `view()` says the `system`.
`icons.js`: `gauge`.

## 1.21.1 (2026-11-07)

`liminal.css`: a list item's icon keeps its size beside a long line; a chip stays on one line.

## 1.21.0 (2026-11-07)

The apps' layout as the user gave it: "the specifics are on the right hand side before the icons on the very
right, and the larger window from the left to right is used to describe or display data"; "plugins are
better described as a list of details w/ the specifics in the right hand column, just like the charts had a
right hand column". `liminal.css`: `.app-main.cols` holding `.app-list` (what there is), `.app-data` (the
selected item's data) and `.app-side` (its specifics, before the tray), list items, `.chip`. `icons.js`:
`shield`, `wrench`, `terminal`. Every machine plugin has an `ICON` for the platform's tray ("active plugins,
will be part of the tray on the very right side"): a firewall's the shield, an admin's the wrench, a WSL
distribution's the terminal, the chip otherwise.

## 1.20.2 (2026-11-07)

Commands in a WSL distribution go through `wsl --exec` (machines.linux.Shell, machines.wsl.Wsl, the engine's
instance `wsl -d <distribution> --exec docker`): with `wsl --`, WSL hands the command line to the
distribution's default shell, which expanded `$variables` and split words before the command ran (found on
this PC: a script's `$PRETTY_NAME` came back empty). Scripts and arguments now reach the command as they are.

## 1.20.1 (2026-11-07)

The firewall plugins offer `allow`, `remove` and `wanted`, the admin plugins `service`, `startup`, `register`,
`unregister` and `processes`, by name (`Plugin.ask`, `interface()`): what the platform's page asks of them.

## 1.20.0 (2026-11-07)

The firewall and admin bases of the platform's plugins (the user: "i also need a windows and linux firewall
plugin for the platform"; "and a windows and linux admin plugin for platform"):

- `machines/firewall.py`: `Rule` (one of Liminal's own, or another's read as it is), `app_ports` (the framework's
  pages), `host_port` (what a `docker run -p` entry publishes on every address), `service_rules` (a domain login's
  mail server container on this machine), `Firewall(MachinePlugin)`: the backend a plugin implements (`state`,
  `list_rules`, `add_rule`, `delete_rule`, `enable`, `can_enable`, `exposing`), `allow`/`remove` (Liminal's rules
  only, group "Liminal"), the status and the setup (`enable`, `exposure`: a finding, never a change, `rules`).
- `machines/admin.py`: `SystemService`, `Startup`, `APPS` and `start_command`, `app_of`, `Admin(MachinePlugin)`:
  the rights and how they are had, the framework's services (started when stopped, never an SSH server), the
  apps' startups (read, run, ended, made or removed when asked; the setup makes none), the framework's processes.
- `machines/windows.py`: `PowerShell` (an encoded, wrapped script; failures in their own words, `denied` for an
  administrator's; `json`; `run_elevated` through UAC; `run_admin`: elevated only with LIMINAL_ELEVATE=prompt),
  `is_elevated`, `quote`. `machines/linux.py`: `Shell` (root here through `sudo -n`, or in a WSL distribution
  through `wsl -u root`; targets local, wsl, wsl:<distribution>).
- `machines.CommandError` (`denied`); `MachinePlugin.STEPS` and a `summary` in every status (the WSL base's too).

## 1.19.2 (2026-11-07)

`WslDistribution` is a plugin base, not a contract class: the hooks it gives count as the plugin's own
(`interface()` names them; `ask()` calls them).

## 1.19.1 (2026-11-07)

`machines.wsl.wsl_path` collapses doubled separators.

## 1.19.0 (2026-11-07)

The machine kind of platform plugin, and named Docker instances (the user: "the platform is the interface
for the software/hardware which facilitates the liminal framework"; "the ubuntu plugin needs to be able to
install docker (do everything manually) and allow different docker instances to support the liminal
framework"): `machines.MachinePlugin(PlatformPlugin)` (KIND machine; hooks present, status, setup, run,
instances, scan, settings), found by the registry as `MACHINE`/`MACHINES` and listed by
`registry.machines()`, conforming (`MACHINE_HOOKS`), attached by `attach_registry`, its variables among
the plugins'. `docker.Instance` and `docker.instances()` (this machine's `local`, its contexts
`context:<name>`, a `host`, and what the machine plugins run), `docker.instance(name)`,
`Docker.for_instance`; `Docker(command="wsl -d Ubuntu docker")`, a command with a prefix; `translate`: a
volume's host path as the engine sees it (a Windows path under WSL). A login file's `[server] instance =
name` picks the engine.

## 1.18.2 (2026-11-07)

`docker.wsl()`: on Windows, whether WSL 2 is there (what a local engine runs its Linux VM in); `describe()`
carries it when no engine is installed and no context or host names another machine. INTEGRATION.md says what
containers need: WSL 2 for a local engine on a Windows PC, nothing for a context, native on Linux; every app
runs without containers.

## 1.18.1 (2026-11-07)

The container command is a setting (the user: Rancher): `Docker(command=)` or LIMINAL_DOCKER_COMMAND, `docker`
by default (Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop's dockerd engine), `nerdctl` for Rancher Desktop's containerd
engine, `podman` likewise; `describe()` names it, and a missing command says what gives it.

## 1.18.0 (2026-11-07)

Docker in the framework (the user: "i want to integrate docker with the liminal framework"; "the container
or email server, would be responsible for services rendered outside the local domain"): `docker.py`, a
driver over the docker command alone, windowless (`Docker(context=, host=)`: this machine's Docker or
another's through a context or a host, LIMINAL_DOCKER_CONTEXT/LIMINAL_DOCKER_HOST; `available`, `version`,
`containers`, `container`, `pull`, `run`, `ensure` (made, started or left running), `start`, `stop`, `remove`,
`logs`, `exec`, `inspect`, `health`, `compose`, `describe`; `Service` as `docker run` would make it; `Container`
as `docker ps` lists it; `DockerError`; a runner stands in for the command in tests). A login's file declares
its mail server container under `[server]` (`Scope.service()`, `Scope.docker()`: image, name, context or
host, hostname (the admin host), ports, volumes (`./x:/y` under the login's data), `env_NAME` with the case
kept, restart, command).

## 1.17.0 (2026-11-06)

A domain's login has an account of its own, and the pieces to check its mail server with it (the user:
"the login-app would need it's own admin account ie. admin@liminal.domain.tld it would need to be valid in
the DNS record ... and the admin account could be used to test the server so that it can send and
receive with the user email and also see if emails can be sent to other servers, without error"):
`Scope.admin` ([login] admin = admin@<a host under the domain>; `admin_address`, `admin_host`; the codes
come from it unless [mail] from says otherwise), `Scope.imap` ([imap]: the admin mailbox; `imap_variables`);
`dns.py` (`addresses`, `mx_records`, `txt_records`, `spf_record`: what the machine's resolver says, now);
`mailbox.py` (`MailboxSettings` from LIMINAL_IMAP_*, a file's [imap] and the secret store; `Mailbox.find`:
whether a message with a subject is in the admin inbox, over IMAP). `mail.mx_records` reads through dns.py.

## 1.16.0 (2026-11-06)

What a login is tied to (the user: "have like a setup.cfg for the login, and then like other web apps
use that cfg file to decide the domain/scope of the login"; "login apps tied to domains (with email
server) or local (file://project/folder)"; "use a url regardless, file if local, domain w/ email server
in mail record (lookup) or specified if none in the domain lookup"): `apps.scope.Scope`, read from
`liminal-login.cfg` (`Scope.find`: LIMINAL_LOGIN_CFG, the workspace, the working folder or one above,
the data folder's login/), whose [login] scope is a URL: `file:///...` a project folder (a local login:
no email, no sign-up; its users in the folder's store/data/login or .liminal/login), `https://domain` the
domain's users (their codes through the domain's own mail record, or the [mail] server named;
`members` domain or any). `MailSettings.from_env(cfg=)` and `Mailer(cfg=)` take the file's [mail]
between the saved variables and the environment; `MailSettings.through_server` (an account at a host, not
direct: what a sign-up needs); `mail.mx_records(domain)` (the mail record alone, [] when none).

## 1.15.0 (2026-11-06)

The app as the mail server of the user's own domain (the user: "it looks like i need a domain/email
server for this to work"): `dkim.py` signs what the mailer sends for the domain (RFC 6376, RSA-SHA256,
relaxed/relaxed; From, To, Subject, Date, Message-ID), given a key (`generate_key`, kept by the login app)
and one DNS record at the domain (`dns_record`: `<selector>._domainkey.<domain> TXT v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=...`;
`published` reads it back through the machine's resolver); `verify` does what the receiving server does.
`LIMINAL_SMTP_DKIM_KEY` (the private key's file), `LIMINAL_SMTP_DKIM_SELECTOR`, `LIMINAL_SMTP_DKIM_DOMAIN`
(the sender's domain unless said); `MailSettings.signing`, `signing_domain`, `dkim_record`, `describe()['dkim']`;
`Sent.signed`. With it a message from an address at the domain passes DMARC wherever it lands, home
connection or not; a receiver may still want a reverse name for the address.

## 1.14.0 (2026-11-06)

A mail account kept safely, used at once (the user: "is there a way to add something secure to the python
env?"; "so it looks like i need a domain/email server"): `secrets.py` keeps a secret of the user's in
Windows' Credential Manager under `liminal:<VARIABLE>` (`get`, `put`, `remove`; a stand-in backend
elsewhere). `MailSettings.from_env()` reads the process's environment over the user's saved variables and
takes the password from the secret store when it is in neither, and a `Mailer` built without settings reads
them anew each time, so `liminal-login mail setup` counts for a login app already running. TLS to a mail
server on this machine (Proton Bridge at 127.0.0.1) goes without its self-signed certificate verified.

## 1.13.0 (2026-11-06)

Direct delivery, no mail account (the user: "i am pretty sure you can use a terminal to send email if to
the correct port with right protocol"; Proton's exchangers took a message from this machine on port 25):
`LIMINAL_SMTP_HOST=direct` with `LIMINAL_SMTP_FROM` (your address) sends each message straight to the
recipient's own mail exchangers (`mail.exchangers(domain)`: the MX records through the machine's resolver,
by preference, the domain itself when it has none), port 25, STARTTLS when offered (a code never goes in the
clear unless `LIMINAL_SMTP_SECURITY=none`), the next exchanger when one is not reached. The machine calls
itself `LIMINAL_SMTP_HELO`, else its full name, else `liminal.local` (`MailSettings.helo_name`);
`MailSettings.direct`; `describe()` says `direct`; `Mailer(resolve=)` for a test's stand-in.

## 1.12.0 (2026-11-06)

`Mailer.send` returns the mail server's word that it took the message (the user: "i will need a way to
check the server response to see if it received the email and only if it did, does it wait for the
response"): `mail.Sent` (the address, the server, its reply to the message's data with the code, when,
the message id). The envelope goes step by step (MAIL, RCPT, DATA) so a refusal of the sender, the
address or the message is a `MailError` in the server's own words, and the log line carries the reply.
Every message gets a Message-ID (the sender's domain) and a Date.

## 1.11.0 (2026-11-06)

The pairs are named by the variables (the user: "By the variables"): a plugin's key variable
`MASSIVE_API_KEY` is the login app's pair `massive-api-key`, `ALPACA_API_KEY_ID` is `alpaca-api-key-id`
(`apps.pair_name`, `apps.variable_name`, `KeyVar.pair`), so the login app's pairs, the user environment
variables and the Plugins view name the same thing.

- `Login.names()` (the pairs there are, when a realization can list them; `LoginClient` and
  `EnvironmentLogin` do) and `Login.variables(wanted)`: the variables among `wanted` the login furnishes
  from its pairs, nothing asked twice; a login not signed in furnishes none.
- `Settings.load(env, env_file, login=None)` and `load_settings(login=)`: with the app's `Login`, the
  plugins' variables it furnishes win over the `.env` file, the saved variables and the environment
  (the login is the root authorization); without one, as before.
- `apps.attach_registry(app, only=None)`: every plugin the registry loaded attached to `app` with the
  app's login (one system with `only`; a plugin another app holds is left alone), the names attached
  returned.
- `EnvironmentLogin.vector(name)` reads the variable of the pair's name (`massive-api-key` ->
  `MASSIVE_API_KEY`), or the `pairs` mapping given; `names()` lists the pairs of the variables set.

## 1.10.0 (2026-11-06)

The authorization interface and the plugins' IPC surface (the user: "the app plugins need to use the
Abstract Base Class login as the only way to present an interface for IPC, between plugins and login
and the app as far as AUTHORIZATION"; "the plugins use an ABC plugin to communicate IPC between
themselves and the APP for functionality"; "the app itself (either chart or integrator) has plugin ABC
as well"; "the plugin ABC will enumerate attached plugins and their API").

- `apps/authorization.py`: `Login`, the abstract base every plugin and app holds a realization of
  (`user`, `vector`; `key(plugin)`, `account`, `password` by the pairs' names; `has`, `may`, `signed_in`,
  `describe`); `Unauthorized`; `EnvironmentLogin` reading the user environment variables (the keys'
  store until every plugin is attached through an app). `LoginClient` realizes `Login` over HTTP to the
  login app of a namespace (`LoginRefused` and `LoginUnreachable` are `Unauthorized`).
- The plugin contract: `Plugin.HOOKS` by kind (feed, publisher, assistant), `Plugin.login` and `Plugin.app`
  set by `attach(app, login)` (a record too), `interface()` (its name, kind, system, versions and the hooks
  it answers itself with their signatures), `ask(hook, ...)` (a hook by name; across the pipe once the
  plugin is resident), `detach()`.
- `App.login`, `App.attach(plugin)`, `detach`, `plugin`, `plugins()` (the plugins attached and their API),
  `ask(name, hook, ...)`, `interface()` (the app's own surface, the same shape); `GET /api/plugins`,
  `GET /api/interface`. Tests: tests/test_authorization.py.

## 1.9.1 (2026-11-06)

`forward(..., drop_cookies=(prefixes,))`: the browser's cookies that are not the bound app's business stay
with the front (the charts front keeps the login app's session from the integrator). The bound app's
own cookies keep their path unless `cookie_path` says otherwise, so the main page's request carries
the login's session and the front can ask who is signed in.

## 1.9.0 (2026-11-06)

The apps bound together, `apps/binding.py` (the user: "objects that I can bind together, like the login
app and the integrator app ... I can still link to an existing integrator and get its functions tied
into the chart app ... seamlessly like it is local"): `Binding(name, url, module)` (reachable, its tray,
the prefix a super app serves it under), `tray_of(url)`, `start_app(module, port, env)` (the app's
`serve --no-browser --port N --until-quiet`, detached and windowless), `wait_for(port, seconds)`, and
`forward(handler, method, url, path, cookie_path=...)`: a front passes a page's request on to the bound
app and its answer back as it comes (an event stream chunk by chunk), the bound app's cookies with their
path narrowed to the prefix. `App.serve(until_quiet=seconds)` ends the server once no request has come
for that long (`App.touch`, every request). Tests: tests/test_binding.py.

## 1.8.0 (2026-11-06)

Outgoing mail, `mail.py` (the user: "send an email out, to an email server with correct credentials so
that its not blocked, like proton or gmail"; "this operation can be part lib, and part login app"):
`MailSettings.from_env()` reads one SMTP account of the user's from LIMINAL_SMTP_HOST, _PORT (587),
_SECURITY (starttls, ssl, none), _USER, _PASSWORD and _FROM (Gmail with an app password, Proton Business
with an SMTP token, or Proton Bridge on the machine with no login); `Mailer.send(to, subject, text)` sends
through it (`MailError` names what went wrong without the password; the log names the address masked);
`mask(address)`. The reserved names (`sources/keys.APP`) take the SMTP and login variables, so no plugin
claims them. Tests: tests/test_mail.py, on stand-in servers.

## 1.7.0 (2026-11-05)

The apps' frame (the user, 2026-11-04: "define all this stuff in liminal libs ... the library basically
facilitates the interprocess communication, the way the apps can bind to each other, or interoperate,
or seamlessly connect ... As well as the framework for the graphics. The common themes and drawing
methods"; what is particular to one app stays in that app's repo), built for the first app on it,
liminal-login.

- `web.py`, moved here from the charts app's gui/web.py: what every app's server shares (`listening`,
  `send`, `send_json`, `local_only`, `from_this_app`, `cookie`, `profile_cookie`, `static_file(handler,
  rel, dirs)` reading the first of the folders given, `MAX_BODY`, `WRITE_HEADER`).
- `ui/static/`: `icons.js` (moved from the charts app; the `user`, `key`, `eye`, `eyeoff`, `trash` and
  `logout` icons added) and `liminal.css` (the themes' variables, the base controls, the rail, a small
  app's page); `ui.STATIC` is served beside every app's own files.
- `apps/`: `App` (an app's NAME, TITLE, master ICON, PORT and PORT_VAR, its STATIC folder; `tray()`,
  `items()`, `api(handler, method, path, query, body)` for its routes, `page()`, `start()`/`stop()`/
  `serve()` at its port on 127.0.0.1 alone, a taken port replaced by a free one; `GET /api/tray` and
  `GET /api/app` answered by the frame; every write needs the write header and a JSON object), `Refused`,
  `Tray` and `TrayItem` (the master icon first, then the app's view plugins; the dividers between
  bound apps' trays come with the binding), and `LoginClient` (`sign_in`, `sign_out`, `user`, `pairs`,
  `vector`, `put`, `remove`; `key(plugin)`, `account(plugin)`, `password(plugin)` for the pairs named
  `<plugin>-account-api-key` and the like; the session token in `X-Liminal-Session`; `LoginRefused`,
  `LoginUnreachable`; LIMINAL_LOGIN_URL, 8795 by default).
- Tests: tests/test_apps.py.

## 1.6.0 (2026-11-04)

The data specs, plugin API 2.1 (`sources/data.py`; the user, 2026-11-03: "every plugin needs to furnish
the correct mechanisms for assessing data, data integrity, provide a 'spec' for the data, different
source plugins like massive and Tingo can inherit 'stock_symbol_data'. obviously the api for each
source provider is different so the calls are inherent (external calls to source) of the plugin
itself"). A class per kind of data a plugin delivers, three methods each: `spec()` (the fields and
dtypes of a bar or tick row, the resolutions, the sessions and calendar, the adjustments, the symbol
form; a document's parts; the products and the store each goes to), `assess(frame, since, until)`
(what is held and what is missing, as the coverage ledger's spans; completeness against the calendar's
slots; latency; with a plan, freshness's state: what the coverage planner and the integrator's
assessor read) and `integrity(frame)` (the bad-data rules behind one method, `baddata.malformed` and
`baddata.spikes` called, not copied; duplicates, rows outside the sessions, gaps inside them, a
required field missing; `compare` for two feeds' copies of a span, `audit.compare`; `scan` for the
rules that need the store, `baddata.scan_series`). The fetching stays in each plugin's DataSource.

- `TimeSeriesData`, the feeds' bars and ticks: `StockSymbolData` (the user's stock_symbol_data: the
  consolidated tape's hours, split-adjusted prices, TICKER or TICKER.SUFFIX), `IndexData` (regular
  hours, no volume), `FxData` (Sunday 17:00 to Friday 17:00 ET, day bars UTC days), `CryptoSymbolData`
  (around the clock, UTC days, a market per exchange so two copies' volumes are not judged, trades
  without sale conditions) and `FutureData` (CME sessions, settlement dates, no adjustment at a roll);
  `slots` (the bar starts the calendar expects), `rows` and `wire` (a frame in either shape, the feeds'
  or the store's). A feed plugin declares its own where the vendor's data differs
  (`FeedPlugin.data = {"stock": MassiveStockData}`, a subclass of the asset class's) and the contract
  gives the asset class's otherwise (`FeedPlugin.data_for(asset)`), so every plugin conforms unchanged.
- `DocumentData`, the publishers' documents, with the parts `Paragraph`, `Page` and `Statement` and
  `Document` (the original as the stores hold it, with its pages and the statements parsed from it):
  `ReleaseData` (an agency's items, GOV_ITEMS), `HeadlineData` (a vendor's headlines, NEWS) and
  `FilingData` (a filing's pages and statements: the `FILINGS` kind, to be registered in
  storage/documents.KINDS when filings are fetched); a document's completeness is its required
  fields, every page in its run and every statement parsed through; a publisher declares its class
  (`PublisherPlugin.data`) or takes its kind's (`PublisherPlugin.document_data()`: a vendor's
  headlines, every other's releases).
- Storage, in the classes (the user: "mongo is used to store the original source document, while a
  different database is used to evaluate or derive information from the original document"): each
  class's `products` (`Product`: the Store picker's type, the engines, where) name the original (a
  document to MongoDB, or SQLite until it moves; a feed's bars to its file, its closed months to
  DuckDB, its ticks) and what is evaluated or derived from it (parsed statements, the AI evaluations,
  the bars built here, the pruned list), kept apart in SQLite or DuckDB, keyed to the original
  (`keyed_to`) and never written back; `check()` holds a class to it. Nothing moves today.
- The contract: `registry.PLUGIN_API` 2.1; a 2.0 plugin loads unchanged (`api_refusal`); a plugin
  declaring `data` says `api = "2.1"`; `Plugin.api`'s default stays 2.0. The conformance check reads
  the declarations: a feed's `data` maps its asset classes to subclasses of theirs, a publisher's is
  a DocumentData subclass or None, each class a plugin answers with gives its spec and passes its own
  `check()`, a declaration needs 2.1 or later.
- Tests: tests/test_data_specs.py (each class's spec and slots, an assessment with known gaps and
  latency, an integrity report on malformed, duplicate, out-of-session and spiky rows, a document's
  parts and completeness, the contract's defaults and a plugin's own, the conformance rule, a 2.0
  plugin loading under 2.1). The charts app pins the contract's version in two tests of its own
  (tests/test_plugins.py: `PLUGIN_API == "2.0"`, and a plugin for 2.1 expected to be left out): they
  move with the app's pin of the library.

## 1.5.1 (2026-11-04)

`collector.sync` is a plain wrapper of `Collector(...).run(...)` again: the charts app's test reads the
run's first stage (`Collector._before_symbols`) since the app moved to the classes, so the copied
signature and `sync.__wrapped__` go.

## 1.5.0 (2026-11-03)

The library's core classes (Phase 5 of the object-oriented rewrite; the user: the plugins and apps
"follow inheritance/oop paradigm"). The rule: a class owns a run's or a view's state and the
decisions; the hot loops and the pure functions stay functions; every module keeps a function under
each name a caller or a test used, so nothing that imports the library changes (the charts app and
the integrator move to the classes in their own commits); a class calls the module's functions
through the module (a test's stand-in is the one used) and reads the module's constants when a
stage runs, never when it is made.

- The runs (5a). `collector.Collector(source, store, tier, *, now, log, refresh_hours, feeds, audits,
  futures_per_run, proxies)`: a feed's scheduled run, stage by stage (`_before_symbols`, `_plan_run`,
  `_step(item, urgent)`, `_after_symbols`; `run(only, published_only, on_item, directory_allowance) ->
  SyncResult`); `sync(...)` is `Collector(...).run(...)`, its source the class's (inspect.getsource; the
  signature its own). `RunQueue` (the run's rows on the fetch queue; `_Queue` kept); `SYMBOLS_PER_MONTH`
  a mapping that reads the plugins' monthly caps when asked, not when the module loads, so
  `monthly_cap` is lazy. `audit.Auditor(source, store, me, feeds, now, log, rng)` (`run`, `span`,
  `random_span`, `window`; its watch rows read once). `initializer.Initializer(store, feeds,
  futures_feeds, source, now).run(exchanges, by, dry_run)`. Stay functions: sync_bars, _fill, _plan,
  verify_fetched, sync_future, check_listing, daily_first, market_days, refresh_directory,
  fill_directory_icons, scan, history_floor; audit.compare, box, spot, allowance, audit_span.
- The planning (5b). `coverage.Planner(store, feeds, now).plan(me, ticker, asset, timespan, floor,
  listed_from, exchange)`: the audit scores and the standing scheme read once when first needed, a
  ticker's watch rows and a feed's quality the first time they are asked for (`forget(ticker)` reads
  the rows again), the coverage ledger for every plan; the collector makes one planner per symbol
  step, per daily-first sweep and per scan. `sourcing.Scheme.build`, `Scheme.standing` (the cache the
  class's, by store), `Scheme.reports`, `Scheme.offered` (the field `offers` is the offers a scheme
  was built from) and `scheme.text(reports)`; `sourcing.Scans` (`keep`, `last`, `read`, `at`,
  `plans`, `apply`): the providers' capability scans (kv SCAN_KEY) in one place. `derive.Builder(store,
  log)` (`chain`, `symbol`, `run`) and `derive.Lease(store, source, ticker)`, a context manager over
  the build leases; `baddata.Scanner(store, log)` (`symbol`, `repair_from_ticks`, `entries`). Stay
  functions: frontier_ms, subtract, intersect, eras_ahead, has_open_time, latency, rank, same_market;
  derive.aggregate (vectorised), the marks and leases; malformed, spikes, inconsistent, scan_series.
- The settings and the services (5c). `config.Settings.load(env, env_file)` and
  `settings.with_detected(plans)`; `config.UserEnvironment(registry, names)` (`saved`, `save`): the
  user's saved environment variables, the winreg code (a stand-in registry works on any OS).
  `datasets.DatasetFetcher(store, today, session, log)` (`fetch`, `files`, `git`) and `FileQueue`
  (`_FileQueue` kept). `publications.Reader.for_view`, `Reader.view`, `Reader.run_due`,
  `Reader.recheck_now`. `killswitch.KillSwitch(store)` (`killed`, `strike`, `release`, `kills`).
  `runner.Runner(store_factory, settings, log)` (`run`, `plugin`). `live.Recorder.for_settings(settings,
  locks, stop, log)`: the charts app's `make_recorder`. `host.Attachment.to(name, db_path, start, wait,
  log)` and `host.Host.start(name, db_path)` (a host's wait for its first client is `start_wait` now);
  `attach`, `start_host` and `attach_or_start` kept (the integrator imports them by name).
- Stays functional, deliberately: `sessions.py` (the calendar masks), `freshness.expected` and the
  publication rules, `storage/*` (the queries), `stores.py`, `memory.py`, `resources.py`, `proc.py`,
  `ratelimit.py` (classes already), `gov.view`, `gov.parameters`, `gov.upcoming`.
- Tests: tests/test_run_classes.py, tests/test_planning_classes.py, tests/test_settings_classes.py (each
  class's state across calls, the wrappers, a stand-in set on the module used by the class, a constant
  read when the run runs). With another checkout of the library installed editable, the suite needs
  this checkout's `src` first on PYTHONPATH.

## 1.4.2 (2026-11-03)

The recorder's command pattern (`live.RECORDER_COMMAND`: a stray recorder ended by the one holding the
machine lock) reads the new names, `-m liminal_charts live` and `liminal-charts live`, and the old ones
still (a process started before the rename).

## 1.4.1 (2026-11-03)

The class contract's conformance check, `sources/conformance.py` (the user: "evaluate each functional
piece of software or plugin and verify correctness and valid functionality through unit tests created to
address new class scheme"): `problems(plugin)` lists every way a plugin falls short of the contract, read
from the plugin alone (its name, title, contract version, system and kind, keys and variables, hooks,
`with_()`, and what its kind declares: a feed's assets, resolutions, delays and hours; a publisher's feeds
and datasets; an assistant's plans, models, prices, sources and caps); `assert_conforms`,
`assert_module_conforms` and `plugins_of` for the tests: every plugin package's tests/test_contract.py,
and the charts app's test over every plugin found.

## 1.4.0 (2026-11-03)

Renamed `liminal-libs` (the package `liminal_libs`): the naming by system (the user, 2026-11-03: apps are
`liminal-<app>`, the one library `liminal-libs`, plugins `plugin-<app>-<name>`). The charts app is
`liminal-charts` (`liminal_charts`, the command `liminal-charts`; `host.APP_MODULE`), the stock-data
plugins `plugin-integrator-<name>`, the AI plugins `plugin-platform-<name>`; `resources.role_of` reads
the new names and the old (a task registered before). INTEGRATION.md: how the repositories fit
together. Every import of `liminal_lib` becomes `liminal_libs`; nothing else changes.

## 1.3.1 (2026-11-03)

Which plugins a process loads is a selection (`registry.Selection`, LIMINAL_PLUGINS_LOADED; `select`,
`selection`, `plugins_loaded`): every plugin found by default, the ones named (each with its parts: boats
keeps Alpaca, sec keeps Federal), or none at all (the user: "the default case is to load all plugins,
however the integrator can be loaded with select plugins or none"; the integrator's `--plugins`). The
plugins found but not named are left out quietly (`Selection.left_out`, not `errors()`), a name no plugin
answers to is noted (`unknown`), and a process started by this one inherits the selection. LIMINAL_PLUGINS_LOADED
and LIMINAL_INTEGRATOR_NAME (an integrator of its own, liminal-integrator 1.4.0) are the app's variables
(`keys.APP`), no plugin's.

## 1.3.0 (2026-11-03)

The class contract, plugin API 2.0 (the user: "all the plugins under liminal should basically follow
inheritance/oop paradigm"). `sources/plugin.py`: a plugin is an instance of a `FeedPlugin` or
`PublisherPlugin` subclass, what it declares class attributes, what it does methods overriding the
contract's defaults (`build`, `view`, `rate`, `has_keys`, `serves`, `markets`, `carries`,
`plan_resolutions`, `reporter`, `scan`, `settings`; a publisher's `moments`, `calendar`, `read`); the
registry loads an instance, a class (instantiated) or a module's `PLUGIN(S)`, `PUBLISHER(S)`,
`ASSISTANT(S)`. The record form (`Provider`, `Publisher`: the hooks as callback fields) is a subclass of
the same classes (`is_record`), still plugin API 1.x (`RECORD_API` 1.12; `api_refusal(..., record=True)`),
so every plugin loads as before. `Plugin.gives`, `has_scan`, `has_settings`, `settings_of`, `with_`,
`refusal`; `PublisherPlugin.has_moments`, `has_calendar`, `reads_itself` (the reader, the stores and the
views test these instead of the fields). A feed declares its publication delays and market hours
(`FeedPlugin.delays`, `hours`: `freshness.Delays`, `DELAYS.declare` when it loads; the rows of
`PLAN_DELAYS` and `FEED_HOURS` stay until every plugin carries its own). `config.load_settings` builds a
plugin's own settings for every kind (`Settings.plugin` for a publisher too). `sources/archive.py`:
`PublicFeedPlugin` (its source on the contract's public client) and `CryptoVenuePlugin` (a crypto
exchange's plan and caps, `CRYPTO_VENUE_DAYS`). `Scanned`, `Report`, `Limits`, `Capability`,
`minute_window`, `within`, `server_limits`, `server_per_minute` moved to `sources/plugin.py`, still
imported from the registry.

The AI assistant kind, `liminal_libs.assistants` (the user: three AI plugins "that have a vanilla API, are
compliant with the rest of the plugin structure ... but allow interfacing with Claude, Grock and ChatGPT
Codex via API key, an email / account name", "used to evaluate certain standardized arguments from other
plugins or apps", "extensible, and allow for higher order evaluation"). `AssistantPlugin` (`assistants/plugin.py`:
a vendor's plans, models, prices and source pages written in and dated; its keys `<NAME>_API_KEY` and
`<NAME>_ACCOUNT`, its plan variables and caps derived; its settings an `AssistantSettings`); `Assistant`
(`assistants/assistant.py`: `models()`, `evaluate(argument)`, `connect()`, the vendor hooks; `ResponsesAssistant`
for the OpenAI-shaped Responses API; `AssistantClient` on the contract's client, every error scrubbed of the key
and the account); the arguments (`assistants/arguments.py`: `Question`, `Judge`, `ContextItem`, `Answer`, a kind
registry for a plugin's own); `Evaluation` and `Usage` (`assistants/evaluation.py`), kept in the main file's
`evaluations` table (`storage/evaluations.py`); `assistants.evaluate`, `evaluate_all`, `judge`,
`default_assistant` (`LIMINAL_ASSISTANT`); `assistants/context.py` (context items from headlines, assessments,
reports, evaluations); `assistants/verify.py` (the vendor pages read again: a plugin's weekly CI test). The
registry's third kind (`assistants()`, `assistant_menu`, `ASSISTANT(S)` in a module), `config.load_settings` for
it, `sourcing.detected_plans` with its scans. `HttpClient.post` (no transport retry: an answer may have been
billed), a subclass's `_refusal` and `_final`, `limit_prefixes`; `MachineLedger.take_day(n)` and `charge_day`.
Nothing is sent from an offline copy; the caps are per machine (50 requests, 200,000 tokens a day, 1,024
output tokens, the cheapest model), raised on the Plugins view.

## 1.2.4 (2026-11-03)

1.2.3's `same_market` undone: two feeds naming no market for an asset class count as one market again (the
collector's tests run fakes that name none, and a real feed names one for every class it serves); the app's
one-feed-per-span check asks with the asset class the ticker belongs to instead.

## 1.2.3 (2026-11-03)

`coverage.same_market` says no for two feeds neither of which has a market for an asset class (it said yes, two
blanks being equal): the app's one-feed-per-span check counted Bitstamp's and Coinbase's trades of a pair no
longer watched as one market's double download.

## 1.2.2 (2026-11-03)

Found going through the fetcher's page plugin by plugin (the user: "go through the UI and look for discrepancies"):
a feed of daily bars alone (TWSE's, B3's, J-Quants', Alpha Vantage's, Cboe's) no longer lists a trades database it
can never have (`plugin_databases`: the -ticks.db file only where a feed provides 1-second bars or streams trades);
Cboe's VIX futures feed publishes a contract's day with its settlement after the session (`PLAN_DELAYS["cboe-futures"]`,
end of day; `expected` and `assess` take an end-of-day plan's futures like its stocks), where the Plugins view said
"480 min delayed", the free futures plans' rule.

## 1.2.1 (2026-11-02)

A listing outside the US whose source names another exchange keeps its exchange and still takes the record's
identity (listing date, FIGI, name, details): 1.2.0 returned before recording it, so the listing was never dated
and its daily history waited for a date that would not come.

## 1.2.0 (2026-11-02)

Stocks listed outside the US (the user: "update existing plugins, add exchanges where applicable and symbols").
One stored name per listing, `TICKER.SUFFIX` with Reuters-style suffixes of the MIC (`7203.T` Tokyo, `2330.TW`
Taiwan, `PETR4.SA` B3, `600519.SS` Shanghai, `000001.SZ` Shenzhen, `VOD.L` London, ...: `models.VENUES`); `TSE:7203`
and `7203::XTKS` normalise to it (`symbols.stock_spec`); US tickers and pins are as before. Plugin API 1.12:
`Provider.exchanges` names the MICs a feed carries ("US" for every US listing; without it a stock feed carries US
listings alone) and `can_carry` refuses the rest. A listing abroad keeps its exchange's days: every weekday is a
trading day covering the local calendar day (`MarketCalendar.local_day_session`, the seam for exchange_calendars'
holidays later), through `freshness`, `coverage` and the collector (the watch row's `exchange`), so a Tokyo trading
day on a US holiday is asked for; day bars stay stamped at midnight ET of the local date (`derive.aggregate` bins
by the local day, with no regular-session filter). Publication delays by tier name: `twse`, `tpex`, `b3`,
`alphavantage-free`, `jquants-*` (end of day; `jquants-free` twelve weeks late), `twelvedata-free` (UTC day).
`refresh_directory` asks each feed for its own exchanges' listings (stored in the suffix form), `Store.directory()`
spans every source, `Store.watch_exchanges()`, `mic_names` seeded from `VENUES`; the initializer gives a listing to
the feeds carrying it; audits, bad-data scans and the live recorder leave listings abroad alone;
`sessions.world_calendar` moved in from the app's Markets globe.

## 1.1.1 (2026-11-02)

The Resources sampler reads the app's processes under their new names: `python -m liminal_charts ...` and the
console script (`liminal ...`, `liminal.exe` on Windows), the old module name still (`resources.APP_WORDS`).

## 1.1.0 (2026-11-02)

The app is liminal-charts (the user: "lets rename the app to liminal-charts", "not liminal", "refactor"): hosts start as
`python -m liminal_charts host NAME` (`host.APP_MODULE`), messages name the `liminal` command (the app's console
script) instead of `python -m liminal`, and the library's import test refuses the app and the integrator under
their new names. Plugins import the library as `liminal_libs` from their next releases.

## 1.0.1 (2026-11-02)

The workspace (`layout.py`: `home`, `data_dir`, `plugins_dir`): `common/` the library, `app/` the chart app,
`store/` the integrator with the databases in `store/data/` (the default main file), `plugins/` a checkout per
plugin, loaded from there by the registry (`plugin_checkouts`, origin `plugins/<checkout>`; the same plugin
installed as a package besides is not loaded twice).

## 1.0.0 (2026-11-01)

The library, out of the app ([liminal](https://github.com/pcxmac-dev/liminal), feature/collector at d21b4b8):
every module but the app's own, their names kept, as the package `liminal_libs`. The regular session's filter,
masks and close moved in from the chart's bars module (`sessions.py`); the market proxies became a parameter of
`collector.sync`. New: `logs.py`, the fetcher's host name and its clients' side in `host.py`, `stores.history_due`,
`sources.feed_closed`, `proc.hold_until_interrupted`, the fetcher's requests in `storage/requests.py`.
