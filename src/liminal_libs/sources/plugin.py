"""The plugin contract's classes (plugin API 2.0): what every plugin of Liminal is, whatever its kind.

A plugin is an instance of a subclass of `Plugin`: a feed's (`FeedPlugin`: bars, trades, reference
data, its own fetching), a publisher's (`PublisherPlugin`, sources/publisher.py: news, releases,
rates, datasets) or an assistant's (`AssistantPlugin`, assistants/plugin.py: an AI vendor's API,
evaluating arguments). Each plugs into one of Liminal's systems, and its abstract base names it
(the user, 2026-11-03: "each of those plugins has an abstract base class, based on the system they
plug in to"): `IntegratorPlugin`, the stock-data plugins' (feeds and publishers: "all plugins that
work with integrator are ones that connect to get stock data"), and `PlatformPlugin`, the AI
plugins' ("all the plugins that work with platform are ai"; the platform reports the machine and is
the nexus of the systems' IPC). What a plugin declares is a class attribute (`name`, `title`, `assets`,
`keys` ...); what it does is a method overriding the contract's default (`build`, `view`, `scan`,
`settings` ...): the hooks. The registry (sources/registry.py) finds an instance (`PLUGIN`,
`PLUGINS`, `PUBLISHER`, `PUBLISHERS`, `ASSISTANT`, `ASSISTANTS` in a module, or the entry point
itself) or a class, which it instantiates.

The record form (plugin API 1.x: `Provider`, a frozen dataclass with the hooks as callback fields;
`Publisher` likewise) is a subclass of the same classes (`Provider(FeedPlugin)`,
`Publisher(PublisherPlugin)`, `is_record`), so everything the app asks of a plugin it asks the same
way of both: a hook is answered by a record's callback field when set, by a class's method
otherwise, and by the contract's default where neither is given (`gives` says which).

Plugin API 2.1 adds the data specs (sources/data.py): what each kind of data a plugin delivers is,
how complete and fresh a frame of it is, whether its rows are sound. A feed declares its data classes
(`FeedPlugin.data`: an asset class -> a TimeSeriesData subclass, a vendor's where its data differs
from the asset class's: Massive's SIP tape) and the contract gives the asset class's otherwise
(`data_for`); a publisher declares its document class (`PublisherPlugin.data`, a DocumentData
subclass) or takes the one for its kind (`document_data`). The fetching stays in each plugin's
DataSource; the specs describe and judge what it fetches.

Plugin API 2.2 adds what a plugin attaches to (sources/apis.py; the user, 2026-11-11: "each plugin should reflect the
the API its attached to, and present links that provide documentation ... it should also expose more of what the API
is about"): `apis`, an Api for each thing it talks to (a vendor's API, a command line, PowerShell's cmdlets, the
kernel's interface ...) with the maker's pages, the API's parts and calls (those it uses and the rest), its limits and
costs, and `api_facts()`, what it learned of them while it ran; every app's page draws both.

A plugin instance is shared by every thread of a process: it holds what it declares, never a run's
state. This module imports no registry and no collector: the contract knows nothing of who loads it.
