"""Data providers are plugins: a feed plugin each (sources/plugin.py: FeedPlugin; its record form, the
`Provider` here), holding everything the app needs to know about it.

A plugin is a module that defines `PLUGIN` (a FeedPlugin subclass, or an instance of one: a Provider
record; `PLUGINS` for several), a publisher's `PUBLISHER` (sources/publisher.py) or an assistant's
`ASSISTANT` (assistants/plugin.py). Every one is a package of its own (plugin-integrator-<name>,
2026-11-01), registering under the entry point group `liminal.providers` (pointing at the module, or
at the plugin itself); the plugin directory's checkouts are loaded from there (plugin_checkouts),
and a module dropped in `sources/plugins/` is still found on the next start, as the built-ins were.

What a plugin gives:
- `build(settings, request_budget)`: its DataSource (sources/base.py), with its limiter and caps.
- its keys (`KeyVar`: user environment variables; never written to a file), and how to get one
  (`signup`): tools/set-key.ps1 offers each plugin's keys from `liminal-charts plugins --json`.
- what it serves: asset classes (`assets`; `keyless` the ones it serves without keys), the market
  each is (`markets`), whether it carries a symbol (`carries`), and whether it is a closed archive.
- its plan, rate window and caps (`view`, `rate`), and what its server publishes (`limits`).
  It refreshes its own plan info: its capability scan (`scan`) asks the provider what the key
  really gets and may answer with the plan that shows (`Scanned.plan`: values of its own
  `plan_vars`), which the app applies wherever the user set none (config.with_detected). A
  provider whose answers cannot tell its plans apart says so (`plan_note`); its plan is then
  only what the user chose (`plan_choices`, offered by the key script and the Plugins view).
- facts the rest of the app asks: its kind of data for the composite model, the exchange it is the
  reference for, the bars one request returns, a monthly symbol cap, the bulk symbols' resolution.
- where its data is (`plugin_databases`, API 1.8; layout.py): each feed's files, its datasets' and
  publishers', its rows in the main file, and any database its own code writes besides (`databases`).
- its capabilities (`provides`, `plan_resolutions`, `per_request`, `streams`), from which it reports
  in one standard form (`report`, a `Report`): its subscription, its limits, one line per job it
  can do on that plan (asset class, resolution, market, how far back, how fresh, bars a request)
  and its live streams. The delivery scheme (sourcing.py) reads only these reports; `sourcing`
  shows them. A plugin whose plan says more than its declarations amends its report (`reporter`).

Hooks left out take the contract's defaults (FeedPlugin's methods), so a plain keyed REST feed needs
little more than its build. A plugin that fails to load is left out and reported (`errors()`,
`plugins`), never fatal.

The contract is versioned (`PLUGIN_API`, major.minor; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md says what it holds): a
class is written for 2.x, the record form (Provider, Publisher: the hooks as callback fields) for
1.x (`RECORD_API`, every minor up to it still loaded). Each plugin gives its own `version` (a
package's may leave it empty: its distribution's is used) and the contract it was written for
(`api`). One written for another major, or for a newer minor than this app offers, is left out and
reported like a broken one.

Which plugins a process loads is a selection (`Selection`, LIMINAL_PLUGINS_LOADED; `select`,
`selection`, `plugins_loaded`): every plugin found by default, the ones named (each with its parts),
or none at all (the user, 2026-11-03: "the default case is to load all plugins, however the
integrator can be loaded with select plugins or none": the integrator's `--plugins`). The plugins
found but not named are left out quietly (`Selection.left_out`, not `errors()`), and a process
started by this one inherits the selection.

# The plugin contract this app offers (major.minor): a new minor only adds (a field with a default,
# a helper), a new major changes or removes something a plugin may rely on. A plugin written
# before the contract had a number was written for 1.0 (Provider.api's default).
# 1.1 (2026-10-29): Provider.part_of, a plugin's second feed (Alpaca's Blue Ocean).
# 1.2 (2026-10-30): Publisher.part_of and Publisher.datasets, a plugin of several publishers (Federal).
# 1.3 (2026-10-31): Publisher.keys and KeyVar.secret, KeyVar.hint: every variable a plugin reads
#   declared by it, set from the Plugins view; Publisher.part_of may name a feed plugin (Massive's
#   headlines, in Massive).
# 1.4 (2026-10-31): Publisher.datasets holds the Dataset definitions themselves (sources/dataset.py:
#   files, parser, publication rule), read only from its hosts and stopped by its pause; a library of
#   datasets is a publisher with no feeds (Ken French's, Datahub's; the CFTC's in Federal).
# 1.5 (2026-10-31): Provider.live (sources/stream.py: Live), each live stream or poller declared by
#   its plugin (Coinbase's, Bitstamp's, Alpaca's IEX, Tiingo's Blue Ocean nights); Provider.partial,
#   a feed of one venue's share of the market (Alpaca's Blue Ocean).
# 1.6 (2026-10-31): sources.http (HttpClient, PublicClient: the HTTP client every plugin's builds on)
#   and sources.archive (Archive, a public feed's source, and what the exchanges share); each
#   vendor's client in its plugin (Massive's, Alpaca's, Tiingo's, the exchanges' and Cboe's).
# 1.7 (2026-10-31): Feed.parse and Feed.item_kind (sources.publisher: Read, parse_rss): each feed's
#   parser in its plugin (the Federal Register's, the New York Fed's), an RSS feed read by the
#   contract's reader.
# 1.8 (2026-10-31): the databases a plugin's data is in (layout.Database: plugin_databases), and
#   Provider.databases, Publisher.databases: any its own code writes besides the standard ones (a
#   SQLite, DuckDB or Parquet file in the data folder, or a MongoDB collection on this machine).
# 1.9 (2026-10-31): a plugin's own fetching (sources/fetching.py: Fetcher, Job, Fetched,
#   FetchContext; Provider.fetcher, Publisher.fetcher): its jobs on the shared fetch queue
#   (storage/queue.py), taken by a worker of its own (runner.py).
# 1.10 (2026-11-01): a poller's session calendar through the contract (sources/stream.py: session_at),
#   and the machine-wide ledger a plugin counts its key's uses on (MachineLedger, imported here):
#   what the Tiingo plugin reached into the app for, so it could leave as a package.
# 1.11 (2026-11-01): a plugin's own settings (Provider.settings -> Settings.plugins, Settings.plugin):
#   Alpaca's keys, plan, feed, crypto venue and caps, once config.py's AlpacaSettings.
# 1.12 (2026-11-02): Provider.exchanges, the exchanges outside the US whose stock listings a feed
#   carries (models.VENUES: 7203.T on XTKS); without it, and without `carries`, a stock feed holds
#   US listings only. The directory asks a feed's listings() for those exchanges too.
# 2.0 (2026-11-03): the class contract (sources/plugin.py): a plugin is an instance of a FeedPlugin
#   or PublisherPlugin subclass (an AssistantPlugin's too: assistants/plugin.py), what it declares
#   class attributes, what it does methods overriding the contract's defaults; FeedPlugin.delays and
#   hours (freshness.Delays). The record form (Provider, Publisher: the hooks as callback fields) is
#   plugin API 1.x still, every minor up to RECORD_API, loaded as before.
# 2.1 (2026-11-04): the data specs (sources/data.py): a feed's data classes (FeedPlugin.data, data_for:
#   TimeSeriesData's StockSymbolData, IndexData, FxData, CryptoSymbolData and FutureData, a vendor's
#   subclass where its data differs) and a publisher's document class (PublisherPlugin.data,
#   document_data: DocumentData's ReleaseData, HeadlineData and FilingData, with Paragraph, Page and
#   Statement), each with spec(), assess(frame, since, until) and integrity(frame); the contract's
#   defaults where a plugin declares none, so a 2.0 plugin loads unchanged.
